                        <li>It has been proven in numerous studies that successful people have a common value for time.
                            Across
                            countries and continents successful business men have been studied from all walks of
                            tradition,
                            religion and race. Common among successful individuals is their shared understand of time
                            management
                            and productivity. They emphasize that this is their key secret to success. They have a
                            common understanding
                            that time is a common resource that allows them to reach their goal and therefore they make
                            the most of their
                            time....</li>
                        <li>Set clear and specific goals that you are able to acheive, starting from short-term goals to
                            long-term goals.
                            Then prioritize the tasks that you need to finish of first i.e short term goals that aligns
                            with your longer term goals</li>
                        <li>It is better to plan ahead, therefore plan ahead your scheduale for your whole week or even
                            for the month. In order not to
                            spend time daily preparing scheduale for each day as you go.</li>
                        <li>Use time-blocking technique for your daily planning, that way you allocate different task
                            within an hour. This way you improve
                            your productivity levels for the day and minimaze distraction of thinking of other task in
                            the back of your head.</li>
                        <li>Ask for help and don't be affraid to delegate your task! If it's a personal task that only
                            you can do it, then do not be affraid to ask
                            for help for direction as of when needed. This way you can focus on your core strengh and
                            minimize distraction and wasting time.
